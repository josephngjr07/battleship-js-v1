# Battleship

Battleship is a browser-based implementation of the classic naval strategy game.
Players place their ships on a grid and take turns attacking the enemy board, aiming to sink all opposing ships before their own fleet is destroyed.

Battleship was a game I really enjoyed growing up, so it was an easy choice for this assignment. Beyond nostalgia, I wanted to challenge myself by improving my state management skills and keeping game logic separate from DOM manipulation. 
This made the project a great opportunity to practice JavaScript fundamentals while working with a more complex, turn-based game.
